<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am conducting research in the field of **recommender systems**, specifically focusing on **generative recommendation models** and **sequential recommendation tasks**. If you are interested in any of my current or previous research and would like to collaborate or discuss further, please feel free to contact me at [qyp9909@gmail.com](mailto:qyp9909@gmail.com). You can find an overview of my work below.

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Doctoral Program in Intelligent and Mechanical Interaction Systems](https://www.imis.tsukuba.ac.jp/) at the Graduate School of Science and Technology, University of Tsukuba (筑波大学知能機能システム学位プログラム), under the supervision of Prof. [Hajime Nobuhara](https://researchmap.jp/read0102115?lang=en) (延原 肇). I also obtained my Master’s degree in the same program at the University of Tsukuba, where I began my research on recommender systems and deep learning. Before coming to Japan, I completed my undergraduate studies at Zhuhai College of Jilin University, earning a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the College of Computer Science and Technology. Now, I am a member of the Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Laboratory (計算知能・マルチメディア研究室). You can find more information on our lab homepage: [nobuharaken.com](https://nobuharaken.com/).

My research interests include *recommender systems*, *explainable recommendations with NLG*, and *generative approaches for sequential recommendation*.

### 🔥I am actively looking for positions as a Machine Learning Engineer, Research Scientist, or Data Scientist, where I can apply my expertise in recommender systems and machine learning!!!🔥
